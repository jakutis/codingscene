## Overview

## Installation

  Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/package/codingscene):

    $ npm install --global codingscene

In the shell, run `make`.
Then open the webapp in browser, register your demo user.
To confirm the registered user you'll have to either copy confirmation hash from sql codingscene.users.confirmation field, or have a correct smtp configuration.
Then you login and see that there are no events.
Not only that, but there is also no administrator's panel.
You'll have to INSERT your events, activities, tasks, etc. by hand at this point.
Then you look at the source code and see a perfectly engineered mess.
Plus, no unit tests and no acceptance tests.
Better someone else adds the new features.
Or whatever.
